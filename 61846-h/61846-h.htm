  <h3>ANNUAL MEETING.</h3>

<p>Preparations for our forthcoming Annual Meeting, to convene in the
Central Church, Brooklyn, October 30, are progressing favorably.
The indications are that we shall have one of the most important
meetings ever held by this Association. We hope to be able to
announce through the religious press and otherwise, in good season,
such particulars relating to speakers and accommodations as will be
of interest to our readers. For the present we refer them to the
announcement on the 4th page cover of this <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>.</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="article">

<h3>GOOD AS THREE WEEKS REVIVAL.</h3>

<p>The value of the annual meetings of our great missionary societies
is not measured chiefly by the amount of business transacted,
important and necessary as that is. The information imparted might
be gathered otherwise, but the full benefit to mind and heart can
only be had by participating in the devotions, the instructions in
righteousness, and, indeed, the arousements that are found among
the vast throng that assemble on these occasions. Dr. Withrow said,
at the Saratoga meeting of the Home Missionary Society: “These
three days are worth as much as three weeks revival in giving
a spiritual uplift to the churches.” We believe this to be no
extravagant assertion. Great religious gatherings of some sort have
been common from time immemorial. These have varied according to
the developments of the age.</p>

<p>The problem of the church to-day is the world’s conversion. All
other questions are but side issues. The wonderful developments
of our modern civilization have been preparatory. They have made
it possible for the church to make rapid strides in hastening the
triumphs of the Redeemer’s kingdom. The facilities are ready.
Young men and women with trained faculties for the work are being
graduated from our schools of learning<a class="pagenum" name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a> by the thousands. Nothing
is lacking but the disposition—the mind to work. The chief
value of these meetings is seen in their potency to impart this
disposition.</p>

<p>It is not many years since there was but one truly great and grand
distinctively missionary annual meeting in our land—the meeting
of the American Board. Then there came well up to the front the
annual meetings of the American Missionary Association, and latest,
the meeting of the Home Missionary Society, which, in point of
attendance from abroad, possibly, outnumbered any one ever held by
the Congregational brethren. Other denominations are progressing in
this direction. There is a wonderfully encouraging development all
along the line. The morning cometh; they who turn their thoughts
to our great missionary enterprises are looking toward it, and not
toward yesterday morning, as men blinded by misbelief continually
look.</p>

<p>We call the attention of our readers to the fact that two of these
great annual meetings convene in October, and we trust that but
few obstacles will be deemed so weighty as to interfere with their
attendance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> demand for Our Temperance Concert Exercise, issued
in the May <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, and also in circular form, has
been steady and encouraging. It was recently used in the First
Church, Greenwich, Conn., with gratifying success. Some features
were introduced by the pastor, Rev. Mr. Kellogg, not contemplated
in the preparation of the exercise. Selections were made from the
communications on temperance published in the same number of the
<span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, and read by different individuals. Words
were adapted to Jubilee Songs, giving a pleasing variety, and
recitations introduced in addition to, and in place of, those given
in the paper. We again call the attention of our friends to this
Concert Exercise, with reference to its use.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Stephen R. Riggs</span>, D.D., LL. D., missionary to the
American Indians for forty years, died at the age of 71, at
Beloit, Wis., in August. Like Livingstone, in early life, he was
desirous of becoming a missionary to China, but yielded to what
he considered the overrulings of Providence, and in 1837, with
his wife, went into the far Northwest among the Sioux. He reduced
their language to writing, compiled a dictionary and translated
the Holy Scriptures and hymns. Ten well-ordered churches and many
out-stations were established in the region of his operations,
reaching beyond the British line.</p>

<p>As an author, he did good service. His book, “<cite>Mary and I—Forty
Years with the Sioux</cite>,” has magnified the significance of Indian
missions. Another book, “<cite>Gospel Among the Dakotas</cite>,” portrays
vividly scenes of pioneer life. His memorial of Dr. Williamson is a
tribute worthy of the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a> man and his successful efforts in behalf of
the Indians. Four of his children have labored among the Sioux, and
one of his daughters has entered upon work across the Pacific. Rev.
Alfred L. Riggs, principal of our school at Santee, and Thomas L.
Riggs, of Fort Sally, and Mrs. Martha Riggs Morris, at the Sisseton
agency, are carrying on the work so happily inaugurated by their
father. His life was one of incessant missionary toil, in which for
years he had been aided by his children, and to whom he bequeathed
its continuance, and in the midst of whom he passed from earth to
his reward on high.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">

<h3>OUR INDIAN WORK.</h3>

<p>Never was there a more favorable time for enlargement on our
part. The new impulse to the general cause by General Grant’s
peace policy, augmented by the success of the schools at Hampton
and Carlisle, will be still more accelerated by the schools soon
to be completed by the Government at Chilloco, Indian Territory;
Lawrence, Kansas; and Genoa, Neb. When these are finished and
filled, the Indian schools throughout the country will accommodate
10,250 pupils of the 40,000 school population of the Indians at the
present time. Sec. Teller may be too sanguine in the expectation
that with adequate means the Indian problem will not be heard of in
the next generation, but never before could such a prediction come
so near being true. At all events, the nation and the Government
are fully aroused, and it becomes the American Missionary
Association to bestir itself to do its part. This Association
has now the responsibility of doing the Indian work for the
Congregational churches, the American Board having transferred to
it the whole of its Indian missions. A delegation of the Executive
Committee of the Association, consisting of Rev. W.&nbsp;H. Ward, D.D.,
Rev. Addison P. Foster, Charles L. Mead, Esq., and the Secretary,
made recently a thorough inspection of all the schools and missions
with very favorable impressions, a report of which follows.</p>

<p>Enlargement is imperatively needed in three directions, in addition
to the $20,000 for the current work:</p>

<p>1. At the old and well-established mission at the Santee Agency,
Nebraska, Rev. A.&nbsp;L. Riggs thus details the immediate wants of
that station: additional industrial accommodations; extension of
carpenter shop, $250; blacksmith shop, with five forges, $750;
outfit of tools for the same, $150; general dining hall for
200 boarders, with laundry rooms, $5,000; outfit for the same,
including heating arrangements, kitchen ranges, laundry apparatus,
$1,500; making in all $7,650. Boarding-school house for girls at
Oahe, Fort Sully, $2,500.</p>

<p>2. New mission stations and schools among the Indians now
unsupplied. Three station buildings for native teachers on the
Cheyenne<a class="pagenum" name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a> River, $1,000; missionary’s house at Cherry Creek,
Cheyenne River, $1,500; mission among the Crows, $2,000.</p>

<p>We invite the friends of Indian progress to select from the items
above given in both fields of enlargement the specific object for
completing which they will aid us in whole or in part.</p>

<p>3. An agricultural, mechanical and Normal School, to be founded
perhaps somewhere in Peoria Bottom, a new Hampton located on the
border, with the white man’s civilization on one hand and the
Indian reservations close on the other. This, though it is an
urgent want and essential to the filling out of our general plan,
must await the careful search for a fitting location and the means
to give it a suitable inauguration.</p>

<p>Where shall the work be done for the Indian? One successful
teacher in Indian schools says that the children should all be
brought East, and trained amid the white man’s civilization;
another gentleman, long connected with a Mission Board, holds
that the education should be given wholly among the tribes, so
that the pupils would be trained amid their people and not away
from sympathy with them. We believe <em>both</em> methods are necessary.
The youth trained at home elevates his people as he rises, and
is himself strengthened and helped by his friends who come from
the East with the higher touch of the white man’s culture. Our
schools and missions, those now in progress and the one proposed,
afford the advantages of both plans. We shall aim to combine the
industrial, normal and religious training so as to fit the pupils,
male and female, for the practical duties of life in the field, the
shop and the home, in the school room, in the pulpit and the church.</p>

<p>We have undertaken much. The hour has come for it, and we know that
the friends of the Indian will not suffer us to fail for want of
means.</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO THE DAKOTA MISSION.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. ADDISON P. FOSTER.</p>

<p>The transfer by the American Board of its Missions among the
Dakota Indians to the American Missionary Association made it
desirable that some of the officers of the Association should
acquaint themselves personally with the work. Accordingly, Rev.
M.&nbsp;E. Strieby, D.D., Secretary of the Association, and Rev. Wm.
Hayes Ward, D.D., of the <cite>Independent</cite>, C.&nbsp;L. Mead, Esq., and
your correspondent, all members of the Executive Committee, met
by appointment at the Santee Agency. Three of the party then
visited the mission station at Oahe, D.T., connected with the
Cheyenne Agency, where the party divided, Dr. Strieby returning
by way of the Sisseton Agency, Dr. Ward and Mr. Foster, under the
leadership of Rev. Thomas L. Riggs, the efficient missionary,
entering the great Sioux Reservation and traveling in an open wagon
between three and four hundred miles, mostly in Indian country.
This last-named expedition had<a class="pagenum" name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a> not a little of excitement and
adventure. Camping out at night, fording swollen streams, sleeping
in an Indian wigwam, driving across trackless prairies by the
aid of a compass, running the divides, killing a rattlesnake,
preaching to the wild Indians through an interpreter, spending days
in Indian villages, where hideous heathen mummeries were in full
view, visiting the Indians’ strange earth-built lodges, and their
offensive scaffold burying grounds, we passed through a series of
experiences not soon to be forgotten.</p>

<p>The American Missionary Association has become possessor of three
considerable mission stations among the Indians, in or near Dakota
Territory. At the Santee Agency, which is just across the Missouri
in Nebraska, about thirty miles up the river from Yankton, is a
large and very successful school, a church of Indians with an
Indian pastor, and one out-station with an immediate prospect
of a second. This school and mission work are under the general
superintendence of Rev. Alfred L. Riggs. The children in the
school come not only from the Santees on the Agency, but from long
distances, from the Sisseton Agency, Fort Berthold and Montana.
We were greatly pleased with the intelligence, the neatness and
Christian spirit of these students. They will certainly compare
favorably in every way with the bright young Indians we have seen
at Hampton.</p>

<p>Oahe is the centre of a wide evangelistic work, which has been
organized and is carried on with great energy and success by Rev.
Thomas L. Riggs. At Oahe itself is a mission home, a neat chapel,
also used as a school-house, and three miles away, a second
school-house. A native church is organized here, ministered to most
acceptably by Yellow Hawk, an exemplary and industrious Indian.
We were specially interested in a prayer meeting of Indian women,
which was fully attended and heartily sustained. Oahe is on the
east side of the Missouri, where a considerable number of Indians
have given up their tribal relations, taken up land in severalty,
and become voting citizens of the United States. Immediately
across the river is the Sioux Reservation. This is greatly cut
up by sizable streams which flow down from the Black Hills. On
every stream are extensive and very fertile bottom-lands. Here
the Indians are located, living mostly in tents, but some in log
houses. They are chiefly wild Indians, only a few years since being
on the war-path, mainly different sections of Sitting Bull’s band.
They still wear blankets, and are gaudy in bead-work, and paint
and feathers. But they are now in wholesome fear of the government
and, better still, are anxious to be as white men. Mr. Riggs has
established four stations in Indian villages on the Cheyenne River,
and a fifth on the Grand River. At three of these stations there
is preaching by native pastors, Solomon Martun (or Bear’s Ear),
Isaac Renville and Edward Phelps, by name; at the other places are
schools. The mission at Ft. Berthold is among the Rees, Mandans
and Gros Ventres.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a> These three small tribes long since combined
in one village for protection against their ancient foes, the
Sioux. Rev. C.&nbsp;L. Hall is the missionary here. A mission home and
a chapel are the buildings, both in excellent condition. The work
at this mission is slow in developing results, not from any lack
of faithfulness or adaptation on the part of the missionaries,
for their consecration and fitness are marked, but because these
Indians by their tribal divisions are jealous of one another, and
by their contact in the past with white men of bad character are
corrupt and hard to reach. Mr. Hall has an out-station in his care
at Devil’s Lake, where Rev. David Hopkins, a Sisseton Indian, is
laboring.</p>

<h3>THE RELATIONS OF THE CHURCH TO THE COLORED RACE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. LEWIS GROUT.</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. J.&nbsp;L. Tucker’s speech on the above subject before the
Episcopal Church Congress, in Richmond, last October, has had
a very emphatic indorsement from professional and other men in
the South, and yet not without severe criticism from some of the
colored people, especially in Jackson, Miss., the home of Dr.
Tucker, where he made the speech. It seems that Dr. Tucker is a
man of Northern birth, that he was a soldier in the Confederate
army, after which he became a planter, then a rector, and that
he has had much experience and interest in the education of the
colored race, as planter, teacher and minister. And yet, with all
his acquaintance with that race, there are several important points
pertaining to their history, character and welfare, in which he is
sadly mistaken.</p>

<p>The first mistake of his that I will notice has respect to the
character of the native African. In Africa, he says, “human life
has no sacredness, and men, women and children are slain as beasts
are, and even more carelessly, as less valuable. Human suffering
excites no pity, and blood flows like water.” “That what we call
morality, whether in the relations of the sexes, or in the sense of
truthfulness, or in the sense of honesty, has no lodgment whatever
in the native African’s breast;” and that they have “no words” for
gratitude, generosity, industry, truthfulness, honesty, modesty,
gentleness and virtue, because they have none of these ideas.
Now all this, and much more of the same sort, is the baldest of
hyperbole, far from the truth. During my fifteen years of labor in
that land, I made the study of African character and language a
specialty; and I believe that words representing the ideas above
named may be found in every language and dialect on the continent.
As to humanity and all kindred virtues, they are abreast, if not
ahead, of any and every other people that have not had the gospel.
For honesty and morality, under pure native rule, in many respects,
the Zulus and cognate tribes would put to shame the people in every
part of this land of ours. I have no reason<a class="pagenum" name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a> to believe that I
ever lost a sixpence worth of anything, through their stealing,
in all those fifteen years of my stay among them; and as to the
relations of the sexes, I believe there are ten illegitimate births
here in New England to-day, where there was ever one in Zululand
previous to the incoming of the Dutch and English. To be sure, all
African tribes may not be abreast of what the Zulus used to be, in
these things. And yet Rev. Dr. Crummell, for many years a college
professor and rector of a parish in Liberia, says: “All along the
west coast of Africa the family tie and the marriage bond are as
strong as among any <em>primitive</em> people.” “Their maidenly virtue,
the instinct to chastity, is a marvel.”</p>

<p>2. Dr. Tucker says the colored people of the South are grossly
immoral. If he had made a very deserved exception of the many
who have been brought under the restraints of the gospel by good
mission work among them, within a few years, his charge would
have been more just. But whence came the great excess in vice
which he avers? Could anything else have been expected from long
generations of the peculiar training their bondage gave them? Under
the treatment they had, as Dr. Tucker says, “they quickly learned
to conceal,” “learned lying, stealing and adultery.” By a somewhat
minute detail, he shows how the familiarity and “the intrigues
which the white men” had with the black women wrought in them, as
he says, “the utter destruction of the very sense of virtue.”</p>

<p>3. Dr. Tucker says nothing of importance has been accomplished by
Northern benevolence for the colored people, except to make them
worse—to “build strongholds for the devil in disguise,” to “build
up the kingdom of evil.” Now all this, in which his speech abounds,
I repudiate as false and slanderous. In the course of forty years
I have seen a good deal of mission work, of one kind and another,
at home and abroad, and under the auspices of almost every society
in the world. I have also seen the work of the American Missionary
Association among the Freedmen; and, as the result of all, I am
free to say, I believe Dr. Tucker may go the world over, time
through, ransack all history, and not be able to point to a time or
place where mission work and money have done more, in proportion to
the means employed, than has been done by this Association among
the colored people since their emancipation, two decades since.</p>

<p>4. Dr. Tucker alleges that Northern missionaries are incompetent,
“don’t know what they are about,” or “how to reach the colored
people,” or “how to deal with them,” “barely know a Negro when they
see him.” Well, I am told there are some white people in the South,
who, themselves “don’t know a Negro when they see him,” in some
cases only as they trace his genealogy and find out who his mother
was. But how should Dr. Tucker, himself, be able to know all about
this matter, how to reach the colored people, how to lift them up,
how to heal them, better than other men of Northern birth?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></p>

<p>5. The counterpart of the above charge is, that the Southern whites
are the “only ones” who know how to do good mission work for the
colored race, and that we of the North must put all our money into
their “control.” But what have they ever done to prove such special
fitness to inspire the Negro with confidence in their teaching and
treatment, to prove their own faith in his capacity for a high
order of improvement, to encourage us to put “every dollar” of our
mission money into their hands? Why, after they had had the black
man in their own special teaching and treatment for more than two
centuries, utterly dissevered from pagan Africa, all plastic,
docile and confined, as he was, to their exclusive training, has
his original heathenism been so little improved as to leave the
Negro no better than Dr. Tucker represents him to be. And even now,
what great effort have they made for his improvement in the two
decades that have passed since his emancipation?</p>

<p>Another mistake I find in Dr. Tucker’s speech, the greatest and
most fatal of all, and the last I will notice, is his color line
“plan” for all educational and religious work in the South—a
school and a church on this side of the street for the whites, a
school and a church on that side for the blacks—a double system,
with, as he says, “double the expense.” But neither a system such
as that, nor the spirit that desires or prompts it, will have any
place on earth when the gospel of Christ gets a proper ascendency
in the hearts and lives of men.</p>

Moody &amp; Sankey. Compiled not by an ambitious amateur in musical
composition, it does not seek to force upon the churches a great

practical purposes, and is small enough to go into a side or hip
pocket, a “multum in parvo.” It is cheap, coming by the dozen, for
introduction, so as not to cost over sixty cents a copy. It is
suited to all occasions. It has a logical arrangement, which will
be of constant advantage in the use of it, though those who have it
may not know just how the logic comes in, even as the perfection of
the art of elocution is to conceal the art. Where it has been used
in<a class="pagenum" name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a> our institutions and schools, it has been much approved. It is

<h4>THE INDIANS.</h4>

<p>—The Spirit of Missions urges the establishment of a Protestant
Episcopal Mission in Alaska, and the sending out of a Bishop from
the United States with a score of faithful priests and deacons to
second his efforts.</p>

<p>—A missionary laboring in the Indian Territory reports to
the Sunday-school of the Collegiate Church, New York, that a

grand piano.</p>

<p>—Some years ago the pride of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe schools
in the Indian Territory, was their school herd of several hundred
cattle, which had been accumulated through a number of years’
effort, without material expense to the government. This furnished
employment and prospective income for the school boys. At its most
successful period it was destroyed by an order from the Department
at Washington, directing that the cattle be distributed among
the Indians. After being without the herd for several years the
Department has now started a new one, by purchasing 600 cows and
heifers and placing them again under the care of the Indian school
boys.</p>

<p>—A Chinaman in a town called New-Bendigo, in Australia, where
there is a large Chinese colony, was asked recently what practical
good had been accomplished by the missionaries. He answered as
follows: Before, no one understood God’s Word. Good many work
Sunday all same as week day. Now, no work done on Sunday at
New-Bendigo by my countrymen. Perhaps chop little wood for house,
or wash him clothes; but no go work. No matter poor, every one
no work on Sunday. Before, all worship idols. Now, many come to
church; he no worship idols. When Lee Wah begin to read, good many
had idols in house; thirty more. Myself had one. Now, only ten
houses and stores in New-Bendigo with idols in them. Before, at old
township, good many Chinese steal fowls, everything. Now, no more
steal; every one work; go get job. Before, every night, Chinaman
learn to practice fight. I tell him too stupid fellow. You learn
God’s Word you no want to fight. Now, no more learn to fight. Learn
God’s Word. Before people no care for God’s Word; he no know or
care. Now, good many people like read God’s Word. Before, too much
time, nothing to do. Now, many say I learn to read God’s Word.
Now, no more waste time. I like to read. Before, good many make
fun God’s Word; laugh. Papers were put upon outside of store, make
laugh at Christian. Papers were put up on door of baptized men’s
house. Now, heathen men no more make fun; strong man’s hands tied
up. Himself like it now. Very quiet now.</p>

<h4>REFLEX INFLUENCE OF A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</h4>

<p class="secauth">FROM ADDRESS BY REV. S.&nbsp;L. BLAKE, D.D.</p>

<p>The direct increase to the wealth of the country, in diminishing
the number of mere consumers, and increasing the number of actual
producers and property-holders, puts the business world largely in
debt to this society.</p>

<p>A few figures will help your understanding of the case. In
twenty-one years this society has spent $5,543,636.03—a yearly
average of $263,772.19. In seventeen years, from 1863 to 1880,
from not owning a single dollar’s worth of property of any sort
available for taxation, these people have come to hold property
taxed for $100,000,000, as appears from Southern tax-bills, which
show no respect of color—an average rate of increase from nothing,
of $5,882,352.94 a year. This is a yearly increase greater than
the whole amount spent by this society. That is, this society has
spent $1, and these people, from absolute pauperism, have come into
possession of over $21 of taxable property. These facts answer the
question whether the colored man can take care of himself, and show
that the labors of this society have a cash value which can easily
be computed.</p>

<p>There is still another phase of the cash value of the labors of
this society, as related to the productive wealth of the country.
Here this society touches and increases our material prosperity.
I refer to a more equable distribution of ownership in the soil.
Surely no one can deny that to change five or six millions of
people from paupers to property-holders, produces a very material
effect upon the prosperity of the State.</p>

<p>I believe that it is a settled canon of political economy that
a nation’s wealth is in its soil. Where there are but few
land-owners, and the tillers of the soil are tenants, wealth must
be in the hands of the few, and comparative if not absolute poverty
in the hands of the many. To this state of things belong social
classes, as widely separated from each other as continents. It
goes without saying that landed monopoly and general prosperity
of the people do not go together. I am no advocate of communism;
but I take the ground, and I believe it can be held, that the same
amount of property, somewhat evenly distributed among the people of
a country, adds more to its actual productive wealth and material
prosperity, than the same amount of money would do, held in the
hands of a few, who constitute an aristocracy of wealth and of
blood. Of course, in every state, some men must be vastly more
wealthy than others. But a comfortable competence in one’s hands
makes him entirely independent of his more wealthy neighbor.</p>

<p>It is among the proofs of the increasing material prosperity of
this country, that the average size of farms has decreased from
199 acres in 1860 to 134 acres in 1880; and that the amount of
capital invested in farms exceeds the money invested in railroads,
and in manufacturing, including supplies, by over $2,000,000,000.
Gradually this vast preponderance of wealth is being more equably
distributed among the people. The plantation system, previous to
the war, gives way to the small farm, tilled and owned in many
cases by the former slaves. Take a single case. Liberty County,
Georgia, in 1860, was mostly taken up by large plantations. There
were but 48 farms, “of from three acres to one hundred acres each.”
In 1880 the county was almost entirely owned by colored people, and
there were 1,500 farms. This is an illustration of the yielding of
landed monopoly and aristocracy to popular ownership in the soil,
and to a more general and evenly diffused prosperity. The average
size of farms in fifteen slave States has been reduced from over
368 acres in 1860 to a trifle over 149 acres in 1880, over 50 per
cent. If you precipitate upon the population of a country 1,000,000
citizens, who may become land-holders, you have struck a heavy blow
at landed monopoly, and taken a long stride toward increase of
material prosperity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></p>

<p>Let me give you two or three further facts. In 1878 the freedmen
of Prince Edward County, Virginia, owned 2,305 acres of land,
an increase in eight years of 1,847 acres. In the county of
Rockbridge, Virginia, two thousand blacks were assessed for $50,000
worth of real estate. In 1876 the colored people of Georgia owned
land valued at $1,234,104, and other property to swell the total
to $6,134,829. In the single State of Georgia these people, from
not owning a dollar, have come to possess property greater in value
than the entire sum spent by this Association in 21 years. Who says
that this alabaster box of ointment has been wasted?</p>

<p>Material prosperity indicates a certain degree of intelligence. The
ignorant are not the wealthy nations of the globe. The work of this
Association in bringing these people up to a degree of intelligence
somewhat commensurate with their opportunities, and in lifting
them to a level of citizenship co-ordinate with the welfare and
prosperity of the State, has directly aided in this increase of the
material forces of the nation’s welfare. For if the actual amount
of property were not increased, yet the prospective wealth of the
nation must be by converting 6,000,000 illiterate paupers into
educated, independent property-holders.</p>

<p>I find this in the last issue of the <cite>American Missionary</cite>, which
supports my position with high authority: “It has been estimated
at Washington that the annual profit to the country by the
conversion of illiterate into educated labor cannot be less than
$400,000,000.” This work has been done by this Association.</p>

<p>Money given to the endowment of its institutions at the South would
yield a hundred fold in half a generation.</p>

<h3>NOTES OF AN EDUCATIONAL TOUR IN LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI.</h3>

<p class="secauth">PRES. W.&nbsp;S. ALEXANDER, D.D.</p>

<p>An experiment in the form of a brief educational campaign in
Louisiana and Mississippi has been attended with the most
gratifying results, and has been to those identified with it a
revelation of what may be accomplished in the same direction.
Hitherto in our educational work in Louisiana we have depended, so
far as the patronage of the country parishes was concerned, upon
the good reports of the students, and the dawning conception, in
the minds of those living remote from the city, of the necessity
of an education. It occurred to Prof. Hitchcock and myself, as
we were likely to be detained in New Orleans the greater part of
the summer, that we could in no way better serve the interests
of Straight University than by presenting the facts of education
directly to the people, and pleading its claims wherever there
was “an open door.” We not only found doors wide open, but were
greeted from many parishes with the Macedonian cry, “Come over and
help us.” Our University was represented in the most important
centers, either by our graduates or those still upon our roll.
They had borne to their homes a grateful sense of good received at
the school, and entered enthusiastically into the matter of the
meetings. They were our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant-couriers</i>, and most faithfully did
they spread the tidings of our coming.</p>

<p>In the space of a single article we can do little more than
summarize, but we trust our enforced conciseness will not despoil
the narrative of its interest or value. The first important point
made was</p>
</div>

<div class="article">

<h4><i>Baton Rouge.</i></h4>

<p>The meeting on July 5 at the Capital of the State had been well
advertised, and was largely attended. The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;E. Church (Rev.
Mr. Jackson, pastor) was well filled. The majority of the audience
were young men, just the class we desired to reach. We had not
only a respectful, but an interested hearing. Mr. A.&nbsp;H. Colwell,
a talented graduate of Straight, who fills an important position
as teacher at Baton Rouge, presided at the organ, and at the
conclusion of the meeting made a neat address, moving a resolution
of thanks to the speakers. Rev. Mr. Jackson spoke with feeling and
intelligent appreciation of the demands of education. The ablest
white lawyer in Baton Rouge made a rousing speech, commending
heartily the objects of the meeting.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">

<h4><i>Vicksburg.</i></h4>

<p>The meeting at this point, July 9th, presents many facts worthy
of record. Our young men, Reynolds and Temple, graduates of the
present year, had been untiring in their efforts to make the
meeting a success. Every newspaper in Vicksburg had noticed it
editorially. Every colored pulpit had twice and thrice advertised
it, and urged the people to attend. Influential white people
had been invited, especially members of the School Board. The
Court-House had been applied for, and freely granted by the City
Council for the purposes of the meeting. On the day previous
(Sunday) it was my privilege to preach in two of the most important
colored churches of the city, while Prof. Hitchcock did good work
in the Sunday-Schools. On Sabbath evening I preached in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;E.
Church (Rev. Mr. Carolina,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a> pastor) to an audience of 800
people. It was a rare privilege, and great was the joy of preaching
on the blessed religion of the Lord Jesus to so many people,
and all eager and reverent in their attention. On Monday night
the Court-House an imposing building situated on “the heights,”
overlooking the city, and the first object that attracts attention
as the boat enters the harbor, witnessed the gathering of an eager
and crowded assembly of men and women, roused to no common degree
of enthusiasm by the simple announcement of an “<em>educational
meeting</em>.”</p>

<p>The Court-Room, with the wide halls approaching it and the deep
window recesses, was not large enough to accommodate the hundreds
who flocked to it. It was estimated that 800 entered and as many
more failed to get in. An organ had been brought from one of the
churches, a fine choir had been gathered, and very choice music was
rendered. The leading colored clergymen of the city were present.
The addresses which were made were plain matter-of-fact statements
of the nature and demands of education, the widespread illiteracy
of the colored people, the opportunity offered them of improving
their condition mentally, socially, materially and morally, and
the utter impossibility of their ever reaching a higher place in
any department of growth without the guiding and helping hand of
education. Great plainness of speech was used, and was not only
tolerated but approved by the audience.</p>

<p><i>Rev. C.&nbsp;K. Marshall, D.D.</i>, the author of the vigorous and able
pamphlet entitled “The Colored Race Weighed in the Balance,” a
gentleman of great influence in Mississippi, kindly called upon us
at the hotel, and not only was present at the meeting, but made
an eloquent and telling address, replete with good points. He has
always been a friend of the colored race, and they do not forget
it now. Rev. Dr. Woodworth, of the M.&nbsp;E. Church South, and Hon.
Mr. Chamberlin. President of the School Board, were also present,
and spoke kindly words of approval of the objects of the meeting.
The leading paper of Vicksburg devoted a column and a half to a
favorable account of the proceedings. An old colored man, whom I
saw violently gesticulating as I was going down Court-House Hill,
said, “That meeting was worth one million dollars to our people.”
God grant it may be so.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">

<h4><i>Plaquemine.</i></h4>

<p>The crowning meeting of the campaign was in the town of
<em>Plaquemine, Parish of Iberville</em>, on Saturday night, July 28th.</p>

<p><i>Hon. T.&nbsp;T. Allain</i>, one of the most enterprising colored men in
the South, and one of the most consistent friends of education,
took the meeting in hand at the start, and spared neither time nor
money to bring it to the notice of the whole people. This meeting,
in all its appointments, was so unusual that I shall be pardoned
if I describe it quite minutely. We were met by a committee of
reception at the depot, and escorted to the hotel. One hour in
advance of the meeting, a large cannon, planted in the court-house
yard, made a tremendous salute, causing the very village to
tremble. Peal after peal went forth, each seeming louder than the
last. Torches were lighted and planted thickly in the court-yard,
which, by their glare and smoke, gave a weird look to the hundreds
of dusky faces gathering around them. A large brass band, with a
full complement of pieces, added to the novelty and effectiveness
of the scene.</p>

<p>Think of it, dear friends! This was not a political meeting. It was
not a barbecue. It was simply a meeting called in the interests of
education among the colored people of Southern Louisiana, which has
always been regarded a “<em>pretty dark strip of woods</em>.” Well, now
for the meeting itself! Mr. Allain gracefully<a class="pagenum" name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a> and ably presided,
and made a speech which did credit to his head and heart. For two
hours that densely packed assembly listened to Prof. Hitchcock
and myself with unflagging interest, manifested by frequent
applause. The Court-House and court-yard were filled, and our
audience without and within the building gave us a respectful and
appreciative hearing. Plaquemine has been called the “banner” town.
<em>We</em> certainly have no desire to dispute her claim to the honorable
distinction, for the treatment we received there was “<em>royal</em>.”</p>

<p>The meeting at <em>Donaldsonville</em>, July 12th, was a union of the
Baptist and Methodist congregations, and will result, we trust,
in the awakening of a new interest. I should be glad to speak
particularly, had I not reached the limit of my space, of meetings
held by Prof. Hitchcock at West Baton Rouge, St. Sophie, New Texas
and Beauregour, and visits to Monticello, Darrowville, and Point
a la Hache, where many of the families and homes of the students
were seen. Everywhere he was awarded a warm welcome. People rallied
to the meetings, sometimes from a distance of 12 miles. Genuine
enthusiasm was aroused, and the tide of public sentiment has been
turned, we believe, more strongly toward the “<em>School-House</em>,” and
that was our only object. The “door of opportunity” is fairly open.
Ought we not to enter it and tell the entire people the glad story
of education?</p>

<h3>A WORD FROM TILLOTSON INSTITUTE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">PRES. W.&nbsp;E. BROOKS, AUSTIN, TEXAS.</p>

<p>It is due the many donors and friends of Tillotson that a brief
report of the work of the past year be made. It is a pleasure to do
this, both because due and because of the hopeful prosperity which
has attended the institution.</p>

<p>The land upon which to place the new dormitory and the buildings
for the mechanical department, when funds shall be secured, has
been bought at a cost of $5,000—$1,250 of which was from the Hon.
J.&nbsp;H. Raymond, of Austin. Some progress has also been made in
obtaining subscriptions for the new hall, which is imperatively
needed to meet the pressing demands which are made upon us from all
parts of the State. How urgent this call is may be inferred from
the fact that on the 2d day of last October, one day before the
opening of the school, Allen Hall was full to repletion, and the
work of turning away began, and continued throughout the year, so
that it is safe to say that for every one received one was refused.
We had one hundred in our boarding department during the year. This
necessitated placing four students in the larger rooms, and three
in nearly every other—too many by far, but there seemed to be
no other way. They begged to be received, while the two or three
already in the room, urging us to admit one more, made it difficult
to refuse. Put yourself, dear reader, in our place, and you will
appreciate our condition, and why we allowed this crowding process.
It was the best that could be done under the circumstances. Besides
the one hundred in the boarding department, we had ninety-one day
pupils, making our total attendance during the year 191. We have
no primary department. Our numbers would have been very greatly
increased if we had had the room to store them.</p>

<p>In educational and religious results the past year has been
our best. More and better work has been done. The training has
been more thorough and systematic, and the real progress more
satisfactory. This was to be expected. Each year increases largely
our own knowledge of the work and how best to do it.</p>

<p>Our religious services have been more largely attended and richer
in results. A goodly number found Christ, and gave clear evidence
of a change of heart. One in particular, who had been intemperate
and profane to a sad degree, underwent<a class="pagenum" name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a> a complete transformation.
Our Sunday school was well attended, drawing in quite a number from
the outside, while our prayer meetings, on Sunday and Thursday
evenings, were pleasant and profitable.</p>

<p>The temperance society, with a pledge prohibiting the use of both
rum and tobacco, embraced nearly every student of the institution.
They gave evidence that they had joined for life. Many of them are
doing good work in this direction, in the schools where they are
now engaged in teaching. We have reason to feel deeply grateful for
the advancement along the whole line of our threefold yet one work.</p>

<p>Our closing exercises won the praise of the many who were present.
Among these were Gov. Ireland, ex-Gov. E.&nbsp;M. Pease, Hon. Mr. Swain,
Comptroller of State, Judge Delaney of the Court of Appeals, Prof.
Hogg, at the head of the schools of Fort Worth, and many other
prominent citizens of Austin.</p>

<p>Able addresses were made by all of the above gentlemen and others;
but among them all none was more cordial and appreciative than that
of Gov. Ireland. He urged the students to continue to press onward
and upward, assuring them that the hour was close at hand when
merit will determine every man’s position, and not the color of his
skin. All, including those named, expressed themselves surprised
and pleased at what they saw and heard. It was the brightest day in
our history.</p>

<p>This brief summary of the work of the past year indicates, but
cannot fully unfold, our need of more room. Young men and women
in the same building is an unfortunate necessity. It is the best
and only thing that can be done with safety to the work, and even
this is full of danger. Then to be forced to refuse admittance
to so many is unpleasant. We ought to keep the streams flowing
toward us, and not turn them in other directions or cause them to
cease flowing altogether. As our only institution in the great
Empire State we ought to provide liberally for it, that it may
carry forward the work so auspiciously begun. No field can be more
inviting. Nowhere in all the South is there a more Catholic spirit.
Everything conspires to insure large returns on all investments
in this department of Christian effort. Are there not friends who
will now come forward and render us needed help in the hour of our
necessity? Twenty thousand dollars in cash or approved pledges and
the new hall will be begun. Some two thousand are already secured.
Monuments of finest brass will perish through the wearing passage
of the ages, but those erected for the uplifting of a race are
imperishable. Will you help erect this?</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM FLORENCE, ALA.</h3>

<p>A person in attendance on revival meetings at this place writes to
Dr. Roy:</p>

<p>“I hasten to tell you what a dear Saviour I have found. I have
accepted Him as mine and I mean to serve and trust Him the rest
of my life. Last Sunday the 20th year to a day since my marriage,
I resolved to be a Christian, but thought I would wait till the
middle of the week before starting. On last evening (Monday) I
drove my team down to the boat for passengers, but on finding that
I would probably have to carry them back and hence be kept from the
meeting, I drove away and attended church. When the invitation was
given I could wait no longer; went forward, gave my heart to Jesus,
and to-day I am a new man, not ashamed to tell the world. I was so
glad that I wish others could this afternoon in the praise meeting
speak for my Saviour, whose pleadings I have so long withstood. I
wanted to write you these<a class="pagenum" name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a> words, because I knew you were anxious
for my salvation. How glad have I been always to meet you. No man
would I rather see or hear talk than you. You have caused me to
shed many a tear, but you didn’t know it. Oh I am so glad that
the Lord spared me that I might return to Him. I mean to give the
balance of my days to the blessed master. Shall do all I can to
have others come to Him and live for Him; pray for me that I may be
strong and useful. The Evangelist and his good wife are truly sent
out by the Lord.</p>

<p>“Bro. Brown and they work nicely together. We just seem to be
in a good way. No doubt many will be converted. Up to this time
twelve have been brought out into the light. The Christians are
strengthened, the church encouraged and a good feeling prevails
among the people.”</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM McINTOSH, Ga.</h3>

<p class="secauth">FROM REV. FLOYD SNELSON.</p>

<p>Our school work has been vigilantly prosecuted this year, somewhat
to the end that the great demand which is made upon us for persons
to teach the public schools in this and adjoining counties might be
met. We have twenty-eight students licensed and sent out to work
this year, who have received all or a part of their training in our
school. Still a great many more are wanted. I have appeals before
me now for teachers for seven schools, made up and ready to begin
at any time, that I cannot supply. I do hope to see the day when
some lover of humanity will aid us with the facilities of a regular
boarding-school here, that this great need of teachers in the
common schools may be met. The twenty-eight that have gone out this
year to teach are allowed from 20 to 40 pupils. With an average of
30 in each of their schools, they will be able to start a light in
the dark minds of 840 needy ones.</p>

<p>Our church work, I am very thankful to say, has also received an
additional Divine recognition. At our last communion season, which
was held July 22, sixteen persons, hopefully converted, came into
the fellowship of the church, and six children were brought to be
baptized.</p>

<h3>ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.</h3>

<p>—An effort is being made by Rev. Mr. Roberts, of Paris, Texas, to
organize a church at Dood City, where he has been holding special
meetings.</p>

<p>—A new house of worship has been dedicated at Belle Place, La.
Rev. Wm. Butler, pastor, was assisted by Rev. W.&nbsp;R. Polk, of New
Iberia, in the dedicatory services. The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. furnished a
portion of the funds for the building.</p>

<p>—Rev. B.&nbsp;F. Foster, who labored the past year as pastor and
teacher at Fayetteville, Ark., will prosecute his studies at the
Theological Seminary, Chicago. Rev. John M. Shippen, a recent
graduate of the Theological Department of Howard University, has
accepted an invitation to occupy the place vacated by Mr. Foster.</p>

<p>—Rev. George W. Moore, a graduate of Fisk University and Oberlin
Theological Seminary, has assumed the pastoral care of the Lincoln
Memorial Church, Washington, D.C., under favorable auspices. He is
to supply Dr. Rankin’s pulpit one Sunday.</p>

<p>—Rev. Zechariah Simmons, a licentiate of the North Carolina
Association, has been appointed to take charge of the mission
at Woodbridge, N.C., with reference<a class="pagenum" name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a> to the organization of a
church. The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. has recently purchased a parsonage for his
accommodation.</p>

<p>—The church in Oaks, Alamance Co., N.C., is building a comfortable
house of worship under the supervision of Rev. J.&nbsp;N. Ray, its
pastor, who has received $100 from the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. for the furtherance
of the enterprise. Miss E.&nbsp;W. Douglass, an experienced missionary
teacher, has been appointed to labor at this point.</p>

<p>—Mr. G.&nbsp;W. Jackson and his wife (Rose McCutcheon) are pushing
their mission day and Sunday-school work at Whiteside, Tenn.
They have been visited by Rev. Jos. E. Smith and Mrs. Steele of
Chattanooga, and meetings of much promise have been held.</p>

<p>—The <cite>Clarion</cite>, of Jackson, Miss., gives an interesting report
of the colored Congregational Church, organized by the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
in that city, with Rev. C.&nbsp;L. Harris, pastor. The church has a
membership of 16 and a Sabbath-school of 63. Services are held in
the hall of the Hope Fire Company. The citizens of Jackson have
subscribed liberally toward the erection of a house of worship.</p>

<p>—Rev. S.&nbsp;N. Brown, while furnishing a vacation supply at Florence,
Ala., has been assisted by the evangelist, Rev. J.&nbsp;E. Fields, in a
series of revival meetings, which has resulted in an addition of
twenty members to the church. This is the church which was so much
depleted by the Exodus.</p>

<p>—Rev. A.&nbsp;W. Curtis, of Marion, Ala., on invitation of Rev. Dr.
Raymond, pastor of the Presbyterian Church, has preached on
exchange with him. This is said to be the first expression of
fellowship of this kind the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. preachers have received at the
South. Mr. Curtis has also accepted an invitation to exchange with
the pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church South in the same city.</p>

<p>—Rev. Geo. W. Clark of Athens, Ga., and his people, with aid from
the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., have purchased a lot and are proceeding to build a
house of worship. Up to this time they have held their services in
the chapel of Knox Institute.</p>

<p>—The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. is building a church at Pekin, N.C., with
accommodations for school purposes.</p>

<p>—The church at Chattanooga, Tenn. (Rev. Jos. E. Smith, pastor),
have built a new fence about the meeting house, which has been
painted outside and inside and beautifully frescoed.</p>

<p>—The St. Louis <cite>Globe-Democrat</cite> says, in connection with the
Press Convention: “One remarkable paper was that represented at
the Convention by its business manager, R.&nbsp;C. Edmondson. It was
<cite>The Fisk Herald</cite>, a college paper published at the Fisk University
in Nashville, Tenn.; in fact, the only college paper the colored
people have. It is a nice eight-page tinted paper, well printed
and generally well reading journal.” The <cite>Daily World</cite> says: “The
present number is of neat typographical appearance, and is filled
with interesting reading matter. A liberal encouragement should be
extended to this enterprise.”</p>

<p>—The President of the Produce Exchange, Wilmington, N.C., speaking
of the school of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., says: “The boys, after leaving the
institution, get employment more readily than others, because
their moral principles are higher, and because they are generally
better fitted for intelligent occupation than the majority of those
who profess to have received an elementary education. The people
of Wilmington have great cause for thankfulness that our Negro
population is so law-abiding and faithful to duty; and to take
courage from the results already accomplished in a transition so
violent from a life of slavery to that of freedom and citizenship
in the eyes of the law. The utmost harmony has prevailed between
the races for many years past, and instances of disagreement
between employers and employed are far more rare than among the
whites in the North.”<a class="pagenum" name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></p>

<h2>THE CHINESE.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>RECRUITS FOR THE SOUTH CHINA MISSION.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. W.&nbsp;C. POND, SAN FRANCISCO.</p>

<p>I trust that our friends do not forget how God has begun to fulfil
the prayer which the motto of our mission, “China for Christ,”
and the hearts of our Chinese Christians sent up during so many
years, in the establishment by the American Board of a Mission in
China to co-operate with ours, and to reach, first of all, the
swarming millions in those districts from which our immigrants
have come. In connection with the departure of Bro. Hager to this
field, our Congregational Association of Christian Chinese gave
$500 in cash, and one of its best members and my best helpers as a
co-laborer. Bro. Hager has established his head-quarters at Hong
Kong and has gathered there a school similar in all respects to
ours in California. But this is only a rendezvous. The main work
is elsewhere, preaching the gospel and scattering the word of life
on the main land. Lee Sam is busy with this already; enduring
hardness as a good soldier, and working almost alone. But he will
not be suffered to work long alone. Our helper for years past at
Sacramento, Lem Chung, sailed for China more than six weeks ago,
and has already, we hope been welcomed at Hong Kong. Sustaining for
years a relation to the Chinese of Sacramento every way equivalent
to that which an American pastor sustains in the community where
he labors, he so commended himself by his mental capacity, his
faithfulness, his Christian spirit and consistent walk that while
our Chinese brethren clung to him as few American churches do to
their pastors, he was also “of good report,” or, as the revision
reads it, “has good testimony from them that are without,” both
Chinese and Americans. Whether he will remain permanently in China
is not decided, but so long as he does remain, I doubt not he will
be ready for every good word and work. And now three others among
our helpers, Hong Sing of Santa Cruz, Wong Him Wong of Stockton
and Lou Quong of the West School in this city, are making ready to
depart. They go together. They hope to begin missionary work on
the steamer. They hope to continue it when they reach their native
land. We shall miss them greatly. They have approved themselves
in our service, workmen that needed not to be ashamed, rightly
dividing the word of truth and illustrating its power in their
consistent lives. But with reference to our great purpose, “China
for Christ,” our loss is a gain, and we gladly take others to fill
the vacant places, hoping that these too, trained to preach by
preaching and to teach by teaching, will follow their brethren to
the dark regions across the wide sea.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, a fortnight remains before the close
of our fiscal year. Toward the $12,500 which our work for the year
<em>must</em> cost, we have received in cash and pledges $11,800. To find
$700 more within these two weeks seems to be quite impossible,
by virtue of any resources remaining within the superintendent’s
reach. He repeats over to himself: “My God shall supply all your
need;” he recounts to himself the many mercies past; and how, again
and again, in his own experience, what seemed impossible has come
to pass, and still he questions and he doubts, and asking, seeking,
knocking, can do no better than to cry, “Lord I believe, help thou
mine unbelief.” Before this reaches the eye of our readers, the
fiscal year will have closed, and the account will be made up: yet
<em>not so closed</em> but that if any of our readers are willing to share
with me the load which open doors and proffered harvests have laid
upon me, their help would be most welcome and most <em>timely</em>.</p>

<h3>THE PAPER MISSION, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MISS NANCY MARSH, PROVIDENCE, R.I.</p>

<p>Since we commenced our mission, May, 1880, we have received many
letters asking “What can I do?” To such we have made various
suggestions.</p>

<p>In Stoneham, Mass., the ladies felt they could not send boxes, but
wished to do something, so organized the “Stevens Home Missionary
Society,” and have sent to various places 779 papers and pamphlets,
and 7 Sunday-school books. They have basted 1,465 blocks of
patch-work and sent to seven teachers in Texas, Tennessee, Georgia,
North Carolina and Ladies Island; have basted also 49 handkerchiefs
“from pieces of cloth, to teach the children to sew, and give them
what they needed.” Postage $5.22. They have also corresponded with
several pastors and teachers. The Secretary says; “I am delighted
with some of the correspondence, and enjoy the work very much; am
so glad to help even a little in this good work. I love some of the
dear teachers very much, and it has all come through their dear
letters, heart touching heart, and all for Jesus. Thank you for all
the interest you have taken to help us get started, and for your
aid right along; we have had no names except what you have given
us.” This society has proved very efficient, and they have been so
grateful for the privilege of working, it has been a pleasure to
find them opportunities; it has done them good as well as others.
Some of these letters have been read in their missionary concerts,
and awakened an increasing interest in the community.</p>

<p>A lady in Chesterfield, Ill., formerly a teacher in Utah, and some
young friends have basted 300 blocks of patch-work for teachers in
Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee, feeling, she says, “that
our greatest privilege is to work for the Lord.”</p>

<p>A letter came to us from Middleboro, Mass., saying, “I am very
anxious to do something for the missionaries, and, as I am an
invalid, and unable to give money, I thought I could cut and baste
patch-work if nothing more.” Recently we received a card stating
“I have sent 600 blocks to Chattanooga, Tenn., I would be glad to
do more, but am now unable to do any kind of work, but hope to
sometime, if ever so little.” In answer to inquiries, this lady
says: “The work I sent Mrs. S—— I did lying on my reclining chair
nearly as flat as a bed; but have been confined to my bed many
weeks at a time, and suffering more than words can <a class="pagenum" name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a>tell.” Surely
this service performed for the Master, in such weariness and pain,
shall not lose its reward.</p>

<p>From Claremont, N.H., the question came: “What can a mission circle
do for Christmas?” We suggested a place as affording ample scope
for their ingenuity and generosity; so “the Sunbeams” (the mission
circle) 25 in number, from six to fourteen years, sent rays of
light and gladness to cheer the hearts of these desolate people
in the shape of picture-frames, book-marks, work and scrap-bags,
mittens, pin-balls, spectacle-cases for the old ladies, etc. The
ladies of this place also sent a box of second-hand clothing, which
was greatly needed.</p>

<p>There has been much labor in corresponding with so many persons:
69 letters and postals have been written. This includes work only
among the Freedmen, yet we have rejoiced in the interest awakened
in various places by this means, and are glad to help this good
cause in every way in our power. Aid has been given in various ways
and different places, which, including postage, makes $37.24. This
<em>patch-work</em> has become quite an institution, 2,504 blocks have
been sent, greatly helping the teachers in their work, saving their
time and strength, and helping to form habits of industry which
are so essential to the well-being of these women and young girls,
thus fitting them for usefulness in the future. One old lady, who
is much interested in the young, and fond of patch-work, gave us
78 blocks very nicely basted, which were sent to Ladies Island,
so meeting the needs of a young girl whose quilt had come to a
standstill for want of materials.</p>

<p>In 1882, in order to enlarge our field of operations, we sent
to Dr. Strieby for new names of pastors and teachers among the
Freedmen, and are now able to report that we have forwarded to the
Southern States 1,021 papers and pamphlets, 339 lesson papers,
122 tracts, 74 Scripture cards and 103 Christmas cards; postage
$5.72. Besides these, papers have been sent by several persons
in different States. A teacher in Texas writes, “I should like
Sunday-school papers, temperance, and other tracts, to distribute
as I visit among the people.” “Can make use of the patch-work
and any other sewing prepared; thanks for encouraging words, and
sympathy, we need your constant and earnest prayers.”</p>

<p>From N.C.—“Your Christmas cards reached us safely; the children
enjoyed their gifts, and received them gratefully. My field is not
an easy one, but I am endeavoring with the Master’s help to plant
and replant fruitful seed. Any good reading matter is acceptable.
I need material for my sewing school (one dozen spools of cotton
and six crochet needles, were sent to this school by two young
ladies). Your letter was full of encouragement and good advice,
and strengthened me much. My work is chiefly among the children,
have 50 or 60 in Sunday-school in the morning, and about the same
number attend the Band of Hope every Sabbath afternoon. We have
prayer-meetings every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday evenings. I
have also a Bible-class for adults, which I teach an hour and a
half every Wednesday evening. Have received the patch-work from
Mrs. M., it is indeed a great help to have it basted, my time is so
occupied.”</p>

<p>Ga.—The teacher writes: “Thanks for your interest in us, we pay
for our Sunday school papers, for we think the people prize them
more when they pay for them; but I can send what I receive into
the country, where they are very glad of them; sent your roll last
night out twenty-five miles to a place where they have nothing to
help them; have several places to which I can send, and profitably
use all I receive. We are trying to give the people a little
instruction in mission work; and take up a collection once in three
months; this people need nothing more than to understand that
<a id="Err_2" name="Err_2"></a>there
are others as poor as themselves, and they certainly are very poor,
but, as they receive, they must also give; true growth comes from
looking out. Our day school has over 100, and our Sunday school
nearly as many more,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a> some coming four or five miles, and have been
<a id="Err_3" name="Err_3"></a>very enthusiastic in their work. My scholars are looking forward to
teaching. Last summer 14 were out, and more will probably go this
summer. We are hoping to give them better ideas of religion, that
they may help to change the character of the coming generation. We
have organized a <a id="Err_4" name="Err_4"></a>“Woman’s Missionary Society.” They are to meet from
house to house, taking their supper with them; think it will go far
toward making them better housekeepers, as well as teaching them
to make things, which they will sell, and so get a little money
into their treasury, then they can send a dollar to some cause in
which they are interested. Pray for the success of this society for
through it, I hope to reach the homes, and there is so much to be
done in the homes before there can be much improvement.”</p>

<p>We have had cheering words from pastors in Arkansas and Kentucky,
telling of souls converted, Christians revived and children
gathered into Sunday schools. Our papers have been given where
there is great destitution of reading matter.</p>

<p>At Christmas a few cards and papers were sent to a pastor in
Childersburg, Ala. He writes: “I want to thank your class for
their gifts to the children, who are destitute of such things.
<a id="Err_5" name="Err_5"></a>Our
church was burned a year ago, after a temperance lecture, but the
people are building better than before. We held services in our
church last winter without a stove, and the house all open, yet we
trust the Lord was with us; our school numbered 30 or 40 during the
cold weather and a larger number when pleasant. There are many who
cannot read, and many who can have no Bibles.”</p>

<p>We have been much interested in these pastors and teachers, some
of them have made great sacrifices, and though not appreciated by
those who should sustain and encourage them, future generations
will rise up and call them blessed. We are very grateful to all the
kind friends who have helped us in our work by papers, postage,
patch-work, and in various ways and places, especially for the
Christian sympathy extended to these pastors and teachers. It has
been duly appreciated, and lightened many a burdened heart; so we
trust our “Paper Mission” has not been a failure in the Southern
States.</p>

<h3>A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.</h3>

<p class="secauth">MISS IDA M. BEACH, SAVANNAH, GA.</p>

<p>“The lady asked me was I agoin’ to hear the children make their
speeches,” said a little colored girl but just transplanted from
her Southern home to this Northern land.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Why, it is breakin’ up day in the schoolhouse over yonder, and the
children are goin’ to speak.”<a class="pagenum" name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/topsy.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="right small"><cite>From Harper’s Young People.</cite></div>
<div class="center">TOPSY LEFT ALONE.</div>
</div>

<p>Sitting by my window the next day, voices of children attracted
my attention. Looking up I saw two little ones—a brother and
sister—trudging along followed by another little girl. I noticed
the fresh white dresses and pretty aprons, and that they seemed
to be very much in earnest about something. A half hour later
the mother passed, and it dawned upon me, then, that it was the
“last day of school.” Afterward, riding by the school-house, and
peeping in, I saw rows of bright children and many happy parents
and friends. It brought to my mind<a class="pagenum" name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a> another “last day,” where
were children dressed by just as loving hands in their white
lawns, and pink and cream buntings. Their songs were just as well
sung—perhaps better—for a lady, after spending a day in a public
school of a New England city, wrote: “The children are trained by
a music teacher who receives $800 a year, but their singing could
not be compared to that we heard by the pupils of ——,” referring
to these of whom I am telling you. Their little “speeches” were
recited just as distinctly; the teachers were just as proud; the
parents just as happy, nay, happier. I’ll tell you why by and by.</p>

<p>Have you studied U.S. History? And do you remember the story of our
late Civil War? Then you know that one result of it was that nearly
four million slaves, who were owned by other people, to be bought
and sold like any other property, were made free. They could go
where they chose; work as they wanted to; receive the wages they
earned; make homes for themselves, and not be afraid that their
children would be torn away from them to go with another master.</p>

<p>If you should take the cars in Richmond and ride though—what
States?—till you came to Florida, you would pass through miles and
miles of pinelands scattered all along. Set right in among the pine
trees are little log cabins, the homes of many of these people.
Owning little farms, raising their rice and corn, cotton and sweet
potatoes, they seem very happy indeed. I heard snatches of “Hold
the Fort” coming from within one of these cabins, and remembered
seeing a little church not far away, so I think they must have
Sunday-school, and use the “Gospel Hymns,” don’t you?</p>

<p>Stopping over one train in a Southern city, and inquiring for the
homes of the colored people, you will be directed to almost any
lane. Shall I tell you about one I visited?</p>

<p>Clara told me where to find her. Hunting around among many houses
which were nearly alike, I suddenly saw a face at a window which
I knew must be that of Clara’s mother. I crossed the street and
knocked at the door. It was old and weather-beaten, and fairly
creaked as I rapped.</p>

<p>A little old woman, with a white turban bound about her head,
opened the door. With a courtesy and warm greeting she offered
me a chair. The floor was uncarpeted, but as clean as frequent
scrubbings with soap and water could make it.</p>

<p>Two sticks were burning in the open fire-place, before which stood
a half dozen flat-irons. Mrs. —— apologized for “bein’ a ironin’
on a Saturday,” and after giving a few finishing touches to a piece
on the board sat down to tell me about Clara.</p>

<p>“My husban’ is dead, an’ it is very hard to get an hones’ livin’
an’ keep Clara in school. She ain’t strong, ma’am, Clara ain’t, an’
can’t do much hard work, but she love’ her books an’ want to teach.
She was graduate’ las’ year, but nothing would do but I mus’ sen’
her this year. It is mighty hard to get the money, you know, ma’am,
but I never can give her nothing but an education. I never had none
myself, but, Clara, she is right smart in her books, ma’am. I wants
her to be educated.” The same story oft repeated, “the children,
the children they mus’ be educated.”</p>

<p>Do you know, now, why those mothers were so happy when listening to
the songs and recitations of their children? Can you realize how
proud they are when they find that Nehemiah and Charles Henry can
read and write like any white boys?</p>

<p>Who will hunt up nine others and be one of ten to save ten cents
each month to pay the tuition of one of these children?</p>

life member; and such membership shall begin sixty days after the
payment shall have been completed.</p>

<p>Every church which has within a year contributed to the funds of
the Association and every State Conference or Association of such
churches may appoint two delegates to the Annual Meeting of the
Association; such delegates, duly attested by credentials, shall be
members of the Association for the year for which they were thus
appointed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> The Annual Meeting of the Association shall be
held in the month of October or November, at such time and place as

business.</p>

<p class="center"><b>FORTY-FIRST YEAR</b></p>

<p class="medium">January 1st. 1883, aiming as heretofore to be a safe and valuable
aid in the family to an intelligent and practical knowledge of the
world, and how to live in it. It will urge the claims of religion
upon all, not forgetting the little children; and will discuss the
practical questions of the day with candor; advocating earnestly
the cause of temperance; speaking freely on all subjects, literary,
educational, civil, social or financial, and aiming to speak
wisely. Its reviews and articles, correspondence and comments,
notes and summaries of news, will be carefully edited. It will
seek to be useful to all whom it can reach and will deem it ample
reward for much hard labor, if it can in any way serve the cause
of Christ; having a special love for the old historic churches
of Connecticut, commonly called Congregational, but rejoicing to
be a co-worker with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ, and seek
to bless and save men. We ask the co-operation and patronage of
all who are in sympathy with our aim, and hope for an increase of
subscribers, such as will enable us to work more efficiently in the
field we are striving to cultivate.</p>
